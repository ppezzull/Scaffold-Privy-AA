## üéØ Why zkMed Exists

### The Healthcare Capital Inefficiency Crisis

**Global Problem**: Healthcare systems worldwide waste trillions in idle premium and operational funds that sit in traditional accounts earning 0% returns while patients face rising costs and hospitals struggle with delayed payments.

**Privacy Crisis**: Current healthcare claims expose sensitive medical data across multiple intermediaries, creating privacy risks and limiting patient control over personal health information.

**Payment Delays**: Traditional claims processing takes weeks or months, creating cash flow problems for healthcare providers and uncertainty for patients.

**Investigation Challenges**: Healthcare organizations need comprehensive verification and audit capabilities to ensure claim legitimacy and support proper investigation workflows.
