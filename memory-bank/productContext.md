**Payment Delays**: Traditional claims processing takes weeks or months, creating cash flow problems for healthcare providers and uncertainty for patients.

**Investigation Challenges**: Healthcare organizations need comprehensive verification and audit capabilities to ensure claim legitimacy and support proper investigation workflows.
