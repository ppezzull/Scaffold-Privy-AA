## üèóÔ∏è CONTRACT HIERARCHY & RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. EmailDomainProver.sol (vlayer Prover)

**Role**: Off-chain ZK engine that vlayer uses to verify institutional control of email domains and generate MailProofs for organization verification.

**Core Function**: Inspects incoming emails (captured by vlayer's notaries), extracts "From:" address, target wallet (from subject), and domain, then builds ZK-proof showing:
1. Sender's `From:` address belonged to approved admin addresses (`admin@hospital.org`, `info@insurer.com`, etc.)
2. `Subject:` contained correct target wallet (`"Register organization Hospital for 0x1234..."`)
3. Domain (`hospital.org`) was consistent across email's "From:" and JSON data

**Key Functions**:
- `verifyDomainOwnership(UnverifiedEmail calldata) ‚Üí (Proof, domain, emailHash, targetWallet)`
- `verifyOrganization(UnverifiedEmail calldata) ‚Üí (Proof, OrganizationVerificationData)`
- `verifyInsurerForPatient(UnverifiedEmail calldata) ‚Üí (Proof, insurerDomain, patientWallet)`

**Privacy Guarantee**: Prevents anyone from impersonating legitimate healthcare organizations. Only genuine admin-sent emails yield valid ZK-proofs.
