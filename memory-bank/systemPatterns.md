## üí∞ Merchant Moe Liquidity Book Pool Integration Architecture

### Advanced DeFi Healthcare Infrastructure

**Strategic Innovation**: Leverage Merchant Moe Liquidity Book's advanced discretized liquidity system to implement healthcare-specific pool logic while maintaining proven DeFi infrastructure.

#### Merchant Moe Liquidity Book Healthcare Pool Pattern
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Patient
    participant T as thirdweb
    participant LB as LB Pool Manager
    participant H as Healthcare Hook
    participant R as LB Router

    Note over P,R: Premium Payment and Pool Integration
    P->>T: Monthly Premium (100 mUSD)
    T->>LB: Add Liquidity to Healthcare Pool
    LB->>H: beforeMint() - Validate Healthcare Premium
    H->>H: Verify Patient Registration & Policy
    H->>LB: Approval - Premium Validated
    LB->>LB: Add to Discretized Liquidity Bins
    LB->>P: LP Tokens (Healthcare Pool Shares)
    
    Note over P,R: Claim Payment Processing
    Note right of H: MailProof authorization received
    H->>LB: beforeSwap() - Validate Claim Authorization
    H->>H: Verify MailProof & Payment Instructions
    H->>LB: Approval - Claim Validated
    LB->>R: Execute Swap (Pool ‚Üí Recipient)
    R->>P: Instant mUSD Transfer
    LB->>H: afterSwap() - Update Healthcare Records
    H->>H: Distribute Yield (60/20/20)
```

#### Healthcare Hook Implementation
```solidity
contract HealthcareHook is LBBaseHooks {
    // Healthcare-specific validation
    function beforeMint(
        address sender,
        LBPair.PoolKey calldata key,
        ILBPair.MintParams calldata params,
        bytes calldata hookData
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Validate patient registration and premium eligibility
        _validateHealthcarePremium(sender, params.liquidityConfigs);
        return LBBaseHooks.beforeMint.selector;
    }
    
    function beforeSwap(
        address sender,
        LBPair.PoolKey calldata key,
        ILBPair.SwapParams calldata params,
        bytes calldata hookData
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Validate MailProof and claim authorization
        _validateClaimAuthorization(hookData);
        return LBBaseHooks.beforeSwap.selector;
    }
    
    function afterSwap(
        address sender,
        LBPair.PoolKey calldata key,
        ILBPair.SwapParams calldata params,
        BalanceDelta delta,
        bytes calldata hookData
    ) external override returns (bytes4) {
        // Distribute healthcare yield and update records
        _distributeHealthcareYield(delta);
        return LBBaseHooks.afterSwap.selector;
    }
}
```

  // Domain-verified hospital registration
  registerHospitalWithDomain(
    mailProof: bytes,
    hospitalDetails: HospitalInformation,
    paymentWallet: address
  ): Promise<HospitalRecord>;
  
  // Claim processing integration
  setupClaimProcessing(
    hospital: address,
    systemIntegration: EHRIntegration
  ): Promise<boolean>;
}
```

#### **Insurer Pool Management**

interface IInsurerPoolManagement {
  // Pool creation with custom healthcare hooks
  createHealthcarePool(
    insurer: address,
    poolParams: PoolConfiguration,
    hookConfig: HealthcareHookConfig
  ): Promise<PoolId>;
  
  // Patient relationship management
  addPatientToPool(
    poolId: PoolId,
    patient: address,
