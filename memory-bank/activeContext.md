# zkMed Active Context - Simplified Container Deployment Focus

**Current Status**: Simplified container architecture focusing on essential services for Greeting contract demo and vlayer service integration.

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Active Phase**: vlayer + zkMed Integration & Simplified Deployment

---

## üéØ Current Development Focus

The zkMed development environment now features **integrated vlayer services** with a unified deployment system optimized for development and production.

### ‚úÖ vlayer Integration Complete
- **Unified Container Stack**: Single docker-compose.yml handles both vlayer and zkMed services
- **Shared Network**: vlayer-network enables seamless container-to-container communication
- **Simplified Commands**: Combined Makefile commands for integrated deployment
- **Network Optimization**: Container names used for internal communication, localhost for browser access

## üîó vlayer + zkMed Integration Architecture

### Service Communication Pattern
```
vlayer Infrastructure (anvil, call-server, notary) ‚Üí vlayer-network
         ‚Üì (shared network)
zkMed Application (contracts, frontend) ‚Üí vlayer-network
```

### Port Management
| Service | Internal Port | External Port | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Anvil L2 Mantle | 8545 | 8547 | Blockchain RPC |
| vlayer Call Server | 3000 | 3000 | Zero-knowledge prover |
| Notary Server | 7047 | 7047 | TLS notary service |
| zkMed Frontend | 3000 | 3001 | Web application |
| WebSocket Proxy | 80 | 3003 | WebSocket relay |

### Environment Variables for Integration
**For Container-to-Container Communication**:
```bash
PROVER_URL=http://vlayer-call-server:3000
JSON_RPC_URL=http://anvil-l2-mantle:8545
NOTARY_URL=http://notary-server:7047
```

**For Browser Access (localhost)**:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=http://localhost:8547
WS_PROXY_URL=ws://localhost:3003
```

### Unified Deployment Workflows

**Complete Setup (Recommended)**:
```bash
make all
```
This runs the full integrated setup:
1. Validates environment
2. Starts vlayer infrastructure services  
3. Deploys zkMed with vlayer integration
4. Shows combined status

**Manual Control**:
```bash
make vlayer-start        # Start vlayer infrastructure
make deploy-combined     # Deploy zkMed with vlayer integration
make health-combined     # Check everything is working
make clean-combined      # Clean up all services
```

**Development Workflow**:
```bash
make vlayer-start
make deploy-combined
make logs-combined       # Monitor all services
```

### Integration Benefits
1. **Simplified Development**: One command setup for complete stack
2. **Service Isolation**: vlayer and zkMed services are logically separated but networked
3. **Network Efficiency**: Container-to-container communication
4. **Easy Debugging**: Individual service control and monitoring
5. **Production Ready**: Same network patterns work in production

## üéØ Current Work Focus

### Primary Priority: Simplified Container Architecture

**Status**: üöß Essential Services Implementation with vlayer Integration  
**Architecture Change**: Unified deployment with shared vlayer infrastructure

#### What We're Building Right Now
1. **Unified Container Stack**
   - Single docker-compose.yml with vlayer services included
   - Contract deployer for Greeting contract to vlayer anvil
   - Next.js frontend with server actions (no API endpoints)
   - Shared vlayer-network for all services
   - Simplified deployment with unified commands

2. **Server Actions Architecture**
   - Replaced all API endpoints with server actions
   - Direct blockchain interaction via server actions
   - Simplified state management and data fetching
   - Better SSR compatibility and performance

3. **vlayer Integration Optimization**
   - Uses vlayer anvil-l2-mantle container (port 8547)
   - Leverages vlayer's pre-funded demo accounts
   - Shared network for direct container communication
   - All vlayer services accessible from zkMed containers
