# zkMed Active Context - Centralized Registration & Middleware Architecture

**Current Status**: Revolutionary **hybrid blockchain-based healthcare insurance payment platform** with **centralized registration management** and **middleware-based authentication** that bridges traditional Web2 insurance workflows with Web3 smart contract automation, leveraging cryptographically verifiable MailProofs and Merchant Moe Liquidity Book pools for improved transparency, efficiency, and capital utilization.

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Active Phase**: **Middleware Refactoring & Patient Registration Flow Alignment**

---

## 🎯 Current Development Focus: Registration Architecture Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED

**Major Refactoring Achievement**: Successfully eliminated duplicate `checkRegistration` logic across all containers by implementing centralized middleware-based authentication and a unified registration status hook.

### **✅ Completed Refactoring Tasks**

#### **1. Centralized Middleware Authentication**
- **Enhanced `utils/thirdweb/middleware.ts`**: Added comprehensive user permission checking with smart contract integration
- **Registration Route Protection**: Middleware now automatically redirects registered users away from registration pages
- **User Type Validation**: Automatic routing to correct dashboards based on user type and admin status
- **Wallet Address Extraction**: Multiple methods for extracting wallet addresses from requests

#### **2. Unified Registration Status Hook**
- **Created `hooks/useRegistrationStatus.ts`**: Centralized hook that replaces duplicated registration checking logic
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Direct integration with `getUserVerificationData` server action
- **State Management**: Comprehensive loading, error, and registration status tracking
- **Dashboard Routing**: Automatic redirection to appropriate user dashboards

#### **3. Container Simplification**
- **Removed Duplicate Logic**: Eliminated 20+ lines of duplicated `checkRegistration` code from:
  - `PatientEmailContainer.tsx`
  - `OrganizationDetailsContainer.tsx` 
  - `SendEmailContainer.tsx`
  - `CollectEmailContainer.tsx`
- **Simplified Components**: Containers now focus on their core functionality without authentication concerns
- **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of concerns between middleware (auth) and containers (business logic)

#### **4. Patient Registration Flow Alignment**
- **Updated `usePatient.ts`**: Aligned with smart contract `RegistrationData` structure
- **Enhanced Validation**: Added wallet address matching and role validation
- **vlayer Integration**: Proper proof generation and verification flow
- **State Refresh**: Automatic registration status refresh after successful registration

### **✅ Smart Contract Integration Achievements**

#### **Patient Registration Flow (Aligned with HealthcareRegistration.sol)**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant M as Middleware
    participant H as useRegistrationStatus Hook
    participant P as usePatient Hook
    participant V as vlayer Prover
    participant SC as Smart Contract

    Note over U,M: 1. Middleware Protection
    U->>M: Access /register/patient-email
    M->>H: Check registration status
    H->>SC: getUserVerificationData()
    SC->>M: User not registered
    M->>U: Allow access

    Note over U,V: 2. Registration Process  
    U->>P: registerPatient(email, walletAddress)
    P->>V: generatePatientProof(email)
    V->>P: Return proof + RegistrationData
    P->>SC: registerPatient(registrationData, proof)
    SC->>P: Registration success
    P->>H: Refresh registration status
    H->>U: Redirect to patient dashboard
```

#### **Enhanced Registration Data Validation**
- **Role Verification**: Ensures `registrationData.requestedRole === UserType.PATIENT`
- **Wallet Matching**: Validates wallet address in proof matches connected wallet
- **Email Hashing**: Cryptographic proof of email ownership via vlayer
- **Contract Integration**: Direct smart contract calls for registration verification

### **✅ Architecture Benefits Achieved**

#### **Code Quality Improvements**
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated ~100 lines of duplicated registration checking code
- **Single Source of Truth**: All registration logic centralized in middleware and hook
- **Maintainability**: Changes to registration flow only require updates in one place
- **Type Safety**: Consistent TypeScript interfaces across all components

#### **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Faster Navigation**: Middleware prevents unnecessary page loads for registered users
- **Consistent Behavior**: All registration pages behave identically for authentication
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and loading states
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Client-side hooks provide immediate feedback while middleware handles routing

#### **Security Improvements**
- **Server-Side Validation**: Middleware performs authentication checks before page rendering
- **Protected Routes**: Automatic protection for user-type specific routes
- **Wallet Verification**: Multiple layers of wallet address validation
- **Smart Contract Integration**: Direct blockchain verification of user status
