### Detailed Hybrid Claim Flow Steps

#### **Web2 (Off-Chain) Traditional Insurance Claim Processing**

#### 1. **Claim Submission**
- Patient or hospital submits claim to insurance company via traditional Web2 channels
- Submission channels: insurer portal, email, national EHR integration
- Claim includes all required documentation: medical bills, reports, patient details
- Follows standard insurance claim submission protocols

#### 2. **Initial Verification and Assessment**
- Insurer reviews claim documents and verifies patient eligibility
- Coverage verification against policy terms and conditions
- Manual checks, medical coding, and investigation for claim validity
- Assessment considers deductibles, copayments, and coverage limits

#### 3. **Claim Decision (Approval or Denial)**
- Insurer decides whether to approve or reject the claim based on assessment
- If approved, calculates the exact payable amount
- Decision process follows regulatory compliance and internal protocols
- Traditional claim processing maintains existing workflows

#### 4. **Claim Authorization Email Preparation**
- Insurer prepares **MailProof email** with cryptographically verifiable payment authorization
- Email contains structured payment data: amount, recipient wallets, claim ID, deadline
- DKIM-signed to ensure authenticity and prevent spoofing
- Acts as cryptographic bridge between off-chain approval and on-chain payment

#### **Web3 (On-Chain) zkMed Blockchain Payment Automation**

#### 5. **MailProof Email Delivery**
- Insurer sends the DKIM-signed MailProof email to patient and/or hospital
- Email recipient depends on payment type: reimbursement vs direct hospital payment
- Email serves as cryptographic proof bridging off-chain approval to on-chain payment
- Complete audit trail maintained for regulatory compliance

#### 6. **On-Chain Proof Submission**
- Patient/hospital submits MailProof email (or cryptographic proof) to zkMed smart contracts
- Smart contracts verify DKIM signature, domain ownership via vlayer MailProofs
- Payment instruction schema parsing without exposing medical data
- Privacy-preserving verification ensures payment authorization legitimacy

#### 7. **Automated Payment Execution**
- Upon successful verification, zkMed triggers **instant payments** in mUSD
- Payments executed from **Uniswap v4 liquidity pool** directly to recipient wallets
- Fully automated, transparent, and privacy-preserving payment processing
- Immediate liquidity and cash flow improvement for healthcare providers

#### 8. **Yield Distribution and Monitoring**
- Liquidity pool continues generating yield via Uniswap v4 fees and incentives
- Automated yield distribution per protocol economic model:
  - **60% to patients** (premium cost reduction)
  - **20% to insurers** (operational fund returns)
  - **20% to protocol treasury** (platform sustainability)
- Real-time monitoring and transparent tracking of all distributions

#### **Hybrid Flow Benefits & Rationale**

**Why This Web2/Web3 Hybrid Approach?**
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Insurers retain control over sensitive medical data and manual claim approvals off-chain, complying with privacy laws and operational requirements
- **Privacy Preservation**: Medical and personal data never appear on-chain; only cryptographic proofs and payment instructions are handled on-chain
- **Automation Benefits**: zkMed automates the payment step, reducing delays and errors common in traditional claims payment processes
- **Transparency & Security**: Immutable blockchain records and MailProof verification prevent fraud and enable comprehensive auditability
- **Industry Integration**: Seamless integration with existing insurance workflows while adding blockchain efficiency

#### **Claim Flow Summary Table**

| Step | Description | Location | Technology Used | Benefits |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------|----------|
| 1. Claim Submission | Patient/hospital submits claim | Web2 | Insurer portal/EHR | Standard compliance |
| 2. Verification & Assessment | Insurer reviews claim, verifies coverage | Web2 | Manual/automated checks | Existing workflows |
| 3. Claim Decision | Approve or deny claim | Web2 | Internal protocols | Regulatory compliance |
| 4. MailProof Email Creation | Insurer prepares DKIM-signed payment email | Web2 | vlayer MailProof | Cryptographic bridge |
| 5. MailProof Email Delivery | Email sent to patient/hospital | Web2/Web3 Bridge | DKIM signatures | Secure authorization |
| 6. Proof Submission On-Chain | Patient/hospital submits proof to smart contract | Web3 | vlayer verification | Privacy-preserving |
| 7. Payment Execution | Smart contract triggers payment from pool | Web3 | Uniswap v4 automation | Instant settlement |
| 8. Yield Distribution | Yield generated and distributed | Web3 | Pool mechanisms | Capital efficiency |
