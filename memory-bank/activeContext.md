        uint256 amount,
        string calldata currency,
        bytes calldata paymentData
    ) external;
    
    function payPremiumWithCrypto(
        uint256 amount,
        address token
    ) external;
    
    // Hybrid payment management

    function claimYield() external;
    function getEffectivePremiumCost() external view returns (uint256);
    function getYieldEarned() external view returns (uint256);
}
```

#### **thirdweb Payment Flow Integration**
```typescript
// Healthcare-specific thirdweb configuration
import { createThirdwebClient, prepareContractCall } from "thirdweb";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID,
});

// Premium payment with fiat conversion
const payPremiumWithFiat = async (amount: number, currency: string) => {
  const transaction = prepareContractCall({
    contract: healthcareContract,
    method: "payPremiumWithFiat",
    params: [amount, currency, paymentData],
  });
  
  // thirdweb handles fiat-to-crypto conversion automatically
  const result = await sendTransaction({
    transaction,
    account: smartAccount,
    payWithFiat: {
      currency,
      amount,
      autoConvert: true
    }
  });
  
  return result;
};

// Direct crypto payment
const payPremiumWithCrypto = async (amount: bigint) => {
  const transaction = prepareContractCall({
    contract: healthcareContract,
    method: "payPremiumWithCrypto",
    params: [amount, mUSDToken],
  });
  
  return sendTransaction({ transaction, account: smartAccount });
};
