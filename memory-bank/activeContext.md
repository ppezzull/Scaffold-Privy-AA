# zkMed Active Context - Simplified Container Deployment Focus

**Current Status**: Simplified container architecture focusing on essential services for Greeting contract demo and Dockploy deployment preparation.

**Last Updated**: December 2024  
**Active Phase**: Simplified Container Architecture & Essential Services

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Work Focus

### Primary Priority: Simplified Container Architecture

**Status**: ðŸš§ Essential Services Implementation  
**Architecture Change**: Eliminated complex multi-service setup in favor of minimal essential containers

#### What We're Building Right Now
1. **Essential Container Stack**
   - Contract deployer for Greeting contract to vlayer anvil
   - Next.js frontend with server actions (no API endpoints)
   - Direct vlayer anvil integration (host network mode)
   - Simplified deployment with only necessary components

2. **Server Actions Architecture**
   - Replaced all API endpoints with server actions
   - Direct blockchain interaction via server actions
   - Simplified state management and data fetching
   - Better SSR compatibility and performance

3. **vlayer Integration Optimization**
   - Uses existing vlayer anvil-l2-mantle container (port 8547)
   - Leverages vlayer's pre-funded demo accounts
   - Host network mode for direct container communication
   - No custom anvil containers needed

## ðŸ”„ Recent Architectural Changes

### Simplification Strategy: Complex Multi-Service â†’ Essential Minimal

**Previous Approach**: Complex stack with demo-api, nginx proxy, custom anvil  
**Current Innovation**: Two essential containers leveraging existing vlayer infrastructure

**Why This Change**:
- Eliminated unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead
- Faster deployment and easier debugging
- Better alignment with user preference for server actions over APIs
- More reliable integration with existing vlayer setup
- Reduced attack surface and simpler security model

### Container Architecture Evolution: 5 Services â†’ 2 Essential Services

**Previous Setup**:
- Custom anvil container (replaced by vlayer anvil)
- Demo API service (replaced by server actions)
- Nginx proxy (eliminated for direct frontend access)
- Contract deployer (simplified and optimized)
- Frontend (streamlined with server actions)

**Current Essential Stack**:
- **contract-deployer**: One-time Greeting contract deployment
- **zkmed-frontend**: Next.js with server actions and direct anvil integration

### Network Architecture Simplification

**Previous**: Complex docker networks with inter-service communication  
**Current**: Host network mode with direct vlayer anvil connection

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated network configuration complexity
- Direct connection to vlayer services
- Simplified debugging and monitoring
- Better performance with reduced network overhead
