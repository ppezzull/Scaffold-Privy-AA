# zkMed Project Brief - Advanced Web3 Healthcare Platform

## üéØ Project Vision

**zkMed** is an advanced Web3 healthcare platform that enables privacy-preserving medical claims processing using cutting-edge technologies including ERC-7824 abstract accounts, vlayer WebProofs/MailProofs, Flare FTSO real-time pricing, and thirdweb authentication.

## üîê Core Innovation: Multi-Proof Privacy Architecture

### The Problem
Traditional healthcare systems expose sensitive medical data during insurance claims processing, creating privacy risks and limiting patient control over personal health information.

### Our Solution
zkMed enables **complete privacy-preserving healthcare claims** where:
- **Patients** register with privacy-preserving commitments
- **Organizations** verify domain ownership via vlayer MailProofs
- **Claims** are validated through multiple proof types (ZK + Web + Mail proofs)
- **Payments** use real-time pricing via Flare FTSO oracles
- **Transactions** are sponsored via ERC-7824 for seamless UX
