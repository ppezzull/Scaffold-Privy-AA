# zkMed Project Brief - Revolutionary Pool-Enabled Healthcare Platform

## üéØ Project Vision

**zkMed** is the world's first privacy-preserving healthcare platform that combines yield-generating fund pools with zero-knowledge claims processing. Built on Mantle Network with native mUSD integration and containerized Dockploy deployment, zkMed transforms healthcare economics by enabling patients and insurers to earn 3-5% APY on healthcare funds while maintaining complete medical privacy through advanced multi-proof validation.

**Core Innovation**: Healthcare funds earn yield in Aave V3 pools until claims are authorized, then trigger instant mUSD payouts to hospitals - all while preserving complete medical privacy through multi-proof validation (ZK + Web + Mail proofs).

**Deployment Strategy**: Container-first production with persistent Mantle fork, pre-configured demo accounts, and live frontend accessible via custom domain with SSL.

## üöÄ Revolutionary Value Proposition

### The Healthcare Fund Pool Innovation

**Problem**: Traditional healthcare systems waste $2T+ in idle premiums (0% return) while exposing sensitive medical data during claims processing, creating weeks of payment delays, privacy risks, and high administrative overhead.

**Solution**: zkMed enables healthcare funds to earn 3-5% APY via proven Aave V3 protocols while maintaining instant claim liquidity and complete medical privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.

### Key Innovations
- **Yield-Generating Pools**: Healthcare funds earn returns via Aave V3 integration
- **Instant Payouts**: Pool-authorized claims trigger immediate mUSD transfers
- **Complete Privacy**: Multi-proof validation without medical data exposure
- **Dual Registration**: Flexible onboarding for existing coverage or new selection
- **Native Processing**: Direct mUSD handling eliminates oracle dependencies
- **Container Deployment**: Production-ready scalable infrastructure with live demo
