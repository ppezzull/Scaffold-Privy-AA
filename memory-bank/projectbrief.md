# zkMed Project Brief - Comprehensive Healthcare Insurance Platform with Uniswap v4

## 🎯 Project Vision

**zkMed** is the world's first privacy-preserving healthcare insurance payment platform that automates payments from insurers to hospitals and patients by leveraging cryptographically verifiable email proofs (vlayer MailProofs) and yield-generating liquidity pools built on **Uniswap v4 with custom hooks**. Built on Mantle Network with native mUSD integration and containerized production deployment, zkMed transforms healthcare economics through comprehensive multi-role user management and Context7-enhanced development workflows.

**Core Innovation**: Healthcare funds earn yield in Uniswap v4 pools with custom healthcare-specific hooks until MailProof-authorized claims trigger instant mUSD payouts to hospitals - all while preserving complete medical privacy through advanced DKIM-based email verification.

**Deployment Strategy**: Container-first production with persistent Mantle fork, multi-role demo accounts, live frontend accessible via custom domain with SSL, and real-time development acceleration through Context7 integration.

```

### Hybrid Approach: Why Web2 + Web3?

**Regulatory Compliance & Industry Integration**:
- **Existing Workflow Preservation**: Insurers maintain current claim review processes, ensuring regulatory compliance
- **Privacy Law Adherence**: Medical data remains in traditional systems, never exposed on-chain (GDPR/HIPAA compliant)
- **Gradual Adoption**: Seamless integration without disrupting existing insurer operations
- **Risk Mitigation**: Traditional approval processes minimize regulatory and operational risks

**Technology Innovation Benefits**:
- **Proven Infrastructure**: Web2 handles complex medical assessments, Web3 automates payments
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Blockchain automation only for payment execution, not sensitive data processing
- **Fraud Prevention**: Cryptographic MailProof verification prevents payment authorization spoofing
- **Instant Settlement**: Immediate liquidity through Uniswap v4 pools upon claim approval

### Detailed Hybrid Claim Flow Steps

#### **Web2 (Off-Chain) Traditional Insurance Processing**

#### 1. **Claim Submission**
- Patient or hospital submits claim to insurance company via traditional Web2 channels
- Submission through insurer portal, email, or national EHR integration
- Claim includes all required documentation: medical bills, reports, patient details
- Follows standard insurance claim submission protocols for regulatory compliance

#### 2. **Initial Verification and Assessment**
- Insurer reviews claim documents and verifies patient eligibility and coverage
- Manual checks, medical coding, and investigation for claim validity
- Assessment considers deductibles, copayments, and coverage limits
- Verification against policy terms and conditions using existing systems

#### 3. **Claim Decision (Approval or Denial)**
- Insurer decides whether to approve or reject the claim based on comprehensive assessment
- If approved, calculates the exact payable amount according to policy terms
- Decision process follows internal protocols and regulatory compliance requirements
- Traditional claim processing maintains existing workflows and audit requirements

#### 4. **MailProof Authorization Email Preparation**
- Insurer prepares **MailProof email** with cryptographically verifiable payment authorization
- Email contains structured payment data: amount, recipient wallets, claim ID, deadline
- DKIM-signed to ensure authenticity and prevent spoofing or fraud
- Acts as cryptographic bridge between off-chain approval and on-chain payment execution

#### **Web3 (On-Chain) zkMed Blockchain Payment Automation**

#### 5. **MailProof Email Delivery**
- Insurer sends the DKIM-signed MailProof email to patient and/or hospital
- Email recipient depends on payment type: reimbursement vs direct hospital payment
- Email serves as cryptographic proof bridging off-chain approval to on-chain payment
- Complete audit trail maintained for regulatory compliance and investigation

#### 6. **On-Chain Proof Submission**
- Patient/hospital submits MailProof email (or cryptographic proof) to zkMed smart contracts
- Smart contracts verify DKIM signature, domain ownership via vlayer MailProofs
- Payment instruction schema parsing without exposing medical data
- Privacy-preserving verification ensures payment authorization legitimacy

#### 7. **Automated Payment Execution**
- Upon successful verification, zkMed triggers **instant payments** in mUSD
- Payments executed from **Uniswap v4 liquidity pool** directly to recipient wallets
- Uniswap v4 custom hooks validate payment authorization and execute transfer
- Fully automated, transparent, and privacy-preserving payment processing

#### 8. **Yield Distribution and Monitoring**
- Liquidity pool continues generating yield via Uniswap v4 fees and incentives
- Automated yield distribution per protocol economic model (60/20/20 split)
- Real-time monitoring and transparent tracking of all distributions
- Immediate liquidity and cash flow improvement for healthcare providers
