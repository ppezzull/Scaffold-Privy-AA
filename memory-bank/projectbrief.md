# zkMed Project Brief - Streamlined Web3 Healthcare Platform

## üéØ Project Vision

**zkMed** is a streamlined Web3 healthcare platform that enables privacy-preserving medical claims processing using cutting-edge technologies including ERC-7824 abstract accounts, vlayer WebProofs/MailProofs, thirdweb authentication, and direct USDC handling for simplified, reliable operations.

---

## üîê Core Innovation: Multi-Proof Privacy Architecture

### The Problem
Traditional healthcare systems expose sensitive medical data during insurance claims processing, creating privacy risks and limiting patient control over personal health information.

### Our Solution
zkMed enables **complete privacy-preserving healthcare claims** where:
- **Patients** register with privacy-preserving commitments
- **Organizations** verify domain ownership via vlayer MailProofs
- **Claims** are validated through multiple proof types (ZK + Web + Mail proofs)
- **Payments** use direct USDC amounts for simplified, reliable processing
- **Transactions** are sponsored via ERC-7824 for seamless UX
