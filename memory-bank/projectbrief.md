# zkMed Project Brief - Streamlined Web3 Healthcare Platform

## üéØ Project Vision

**zkMed** is a streamlined Web3 healthcare platform that enables privacy-preserving medical claims processing using cutting-edge technologies including vlayer WebProofs/MailProofs, thirdweb authentication, Aave V3 pooling infrastructure, and native Mantle USD (mUSD) integration for simplified, reliable operations. Built for deployment on Mantle blockchain as part of [The Cookathon](https://www.cookathon.dev/) hackathon with **containerized Dockploy deployment and live demo environment**.

## üîê Core Innovation: Multi-Proof Privacy Architecture with Pooling

### The Problem
Traditional healthcare systems expose sensitive medical data during insurance claims processing, creating privacy risks and limiting patient control over personal health information. Additionally, patients and insurers often lack efficient pooling mechanisms for collecting and distributing funds.

### Our Solution
zkMed enables **complete privacy-preserving healthcare claims with intelligent pooling** where:
- **Patients** register with mailproof from verified insurers OR select an insurer to start paying monthly
- **Organizations** verify domain ownership via vlayer MailProofs
- **Pooling** uses Aave V3 infrastructure where patients and insurers deposit funds that earn yield until authorization
- **Claims** are validated through multiple proof types (ZK + Web + Mail proofs)
- **Payments** use native Mantle USD (mUSD) for stable, reliable processing
- **Transactions** are sponsored via thirdweb's gas sponsorship for seamless UX
- **Deployment** targets **containerized Dockploy infrastructure** with persistent Mantle fork and pre-configured demo accounts
