## üéØ HACKATHON PRIZE TARGETING

### Strategic Prize Mapping
**Target**: 6+ prize categories with substantial, innovative integrations

#### vlayer Integration ‚Üí **2 Prize Categories**
- **Best use of vlayer Email Proofs**: Organization verification (‚úÖ completed)
- **Most inspiring use of vlayer**: ZK medical procedure validation (üöß in progress)

#### Flare Integration ‚Üí **2 Prize Categories**  
- **Flare FTSO Track**: Real-time USD‚Üístablecoin conversion for claims
- **Flare External Data Source**: Hospital license verification (optional)

#### üïí FDC Implementation Priority Notice
**Important**: FDC (Flare Data Connector) implementation is scheduled for last priority due to hackathon time constraints. The core privacy-preserving claims system with vlayer ZK proofs and Flare FTSO price oracles takes precedence to deliver maximum impact within the competition timeframe.

#### Blockscout Integration ‚Üí **2 Prize Categories**
- **Best use of Blockscout Merits**: Merit rewards for successful claims
- **Best use of Blockscout Explorer**: All transaction links to Blockscout
