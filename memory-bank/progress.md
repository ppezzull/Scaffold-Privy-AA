## 🚧 KNOWN LIMITATIONS & FUTURE WORK

### Current System Limitations
1. **Single Email Per Domain**: Each domain can only register once
2. **Admin Email Requirement**: Only admin@, info@, contact@, support@ accepted
3. **Gas Optimization**: Patient registration could be more efficient (115k → 50k target)
4. **Batch Operations**: No batch registration functions yet

### Planned Improvements (Post-MVP)
1. **Gas Optimization**:
   - Implement packed structs for storage efficiency
   - Add batch operations for multiple registrations
   - Optimize commitment storage patterns

2. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Multi-domain organization support
   - Advanced email pattern matching
   - Role update capabilities
   - Cross-chain compatibility

3. **User Experience**:
   - Claims processing system
   - Insurance integration workflows
   - Patient portal interface
   - Mobile application support
