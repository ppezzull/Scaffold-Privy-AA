## üîí Security & Compliance Framework

### Healthcare-Specific Security Patterns
- **Medical Privacy Protection**: Complete MailProof verification without exposing medical data
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy-by-design architecture with minimal data collection
- **HIPAA Readiness**: Audit trail generation and access control frameworks
- **Multi-Signature Administration**: All critical functions require multiple signatures
- **MailProof Replay Prevention**: Email hash tracking prevents duplicate submissions
- **Custom Hook Validation**: Comprehensive authorization checks in Merchant Moe Liquidity Book operations
- **Emergency Controls**: Circuit breakers for critical system functions
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Full verification history for regulatory compliance

### Advanced Security Configurations
```solidity
// Security configuration for healthcare contracts
contract HealthcareSecurity {
    // Multi-signature requirement for critical operations
    modifier requireMultiSig() {
        require(
            adminSignatures[msg.sender] >= REQUIRED_SIGNATURES,
            "Insufficient signatures"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    // Rate limiting for MailProof submissions
    modifier rateLimited(address user) {
        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastSubmission[user] + RATE_LIMIT_PERIOD,
            "Rate limit exceeded"
        );
        lastSubmission[user] = block.timestamp;
        _;
    }
    
    // Emergency pause functionality
    modifier whenNotPaused() {
        require(!paused, "System paused");
        _;
    }
}
```

  // Pool performance tracking
  trackPoolMetrics: async (poolId) => {
    const metrics = await getLBPoolMetrics(poolId);
    await analytics.track('pool_performance', {
      poolId,
      totalLiquidity: metrics.totalLiquidity,
      yieldGenerated: metrics.yieldGenerated,
      claimsProcessed: metrics.claimsProcessed
    });
  },
  
  // MailProof verification tracking
  trackMailProofVerification: async (verificationId, success) => {
    await analytics.track('mailproof_verification', {
      verificationId,
      success,
      processingTime: Date.now() - verificationStartTime,
      verificationMethod: 'dkim_signature'
    });
  },
  
  // User onboarding analytics
  trackUserRegistration: async (userType, registrationMethod) => {
    await analytics.track('user_registration', {
      userType, // patient, hospital, insurer, admin
      registrationMethod, // thirdweb, mailproof
      timestamp: Date.now()
    });
