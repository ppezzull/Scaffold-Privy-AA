## üîê Security Architecture & Patterns

### Smart Contract Security
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with multi-signature requirements
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Comprehensive guards against attack vectors
- **Input Validation**: Strict validation of all user inputs and external data
- **Emergency Pauses**: Circuit breakers for critical system functions
- **Upgrade Patterns**: Secure proxy patterns for future improvements

### Enhanced MailProof-Based Privacy Preservation
```solidity
// Patient Commitment Pattern with MailProof Integration
bytes32 commitment = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(secret, patientAddress));

// MailProof Validation Pattern for Payment Authorization
function validateMailProofPayment(
    bytes calldata mailProof,
    bytes32 paymentHash,
    uint256 claimId
) external view returns (bool) {
    require(vlayerVerifier.verifyMailProof(mailProof), "Invalid MailProof");
    
    // Extract payment instructions without exposing medical data
    (address recipient, uint256 amount, address token) = extractPaymentData(mailProof);
    
    // Verify payment authorization corresponds to claim
    bytes32 authHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(recipient, amount, token, claimId));
    return claimPaymentHashes[claimId] == authHash;
}

// Privacy-Preserving MailProof Claim Processing
struct MailProofClaim {
    bytes32 emailDomainHash;     // Hash of verified domain
    bytes32 paymentAuthHash;     // Hash of payment authorization
    address hospital;            // Hospital receiving payment
    address patient;             // Patient with coverage
    uint256 timestamp;           // Authorization timestamp
    bool processed;              // Processing status
}

// Uniswap v4 Hook Integration for MailProof Validation
function beforeSwap(
    address sender,
    PoolKey calldata key,
    IPoolManager.SwapParams calldata params,
    bytes calldata hookData
) external override returns (bytes4) {
    // Decode MailProof from hook data
    bytes memory mailProof = abi.decode(hookData, (bytes));
    
    // Validate MailProof authorization
    require(validateMailProofPayment(mailProof, extractPaymentHash(params), getCurrentClaimId(sender)), 
            "Invalid payment authorization");
    
    // Verify pool has sufficient liquidity for healthcare payment
    require(validateHealthcarePoolLiquidity(key, params.amountSpecified), 
            "Insufficient healthcare pool liquidity");
    
    return BaseHook.beforeSwap.selector;
}
```

### Container Security
