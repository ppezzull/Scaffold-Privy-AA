# Migration Summary: Server Actions to Client-Side Hooks

## Overview
Successfully migrated the zkMed frontend from server-side actions to client-side React hooks for better performance and maintainability.

## Files Changed

### New Hook Files Created
- `hooks/useContracts.ts` - Central hook for managing contract addresses (client-side only)
- `hooks/useGreetingContract.ts` - Renamed from `getGreetingContract.ts` for consistency

### Files Updated
- `hooks/useHealthcareRegistration.ts` - Updated to use `useContracts` hook instead of server actions
- `components/dev/greeting-demo.tsx` - Updated import path
- `app/organization/page.tsx` - Updated UserType import
- `app/patient/page.tsx` - Updated UserType import
- `components/registration/RoleSelectionDialog.tsx` - Updated UserType import
- `utils/types/zkMed/index.ts` - Updated exports to use client-side hooks

### Files Removed
- `utils/configs/contract-config.ts` - Replaced by `useContracts` hook
- `utils/actions/healthcare-registration.ts` - Replaced by `useHealthcareRegistration` hook
- `utils/actions/greeting.ts` - Replaced by direct contract calls in `useGreetingContract` hook
- `hooks/getGreetingContract.ts` - Renamed to `useGreetingContract.ts`
- `utils/actions/` directory - Completely removed (empty after migration)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed API Request Issue
- ✅ Resolved "Failed to construct 'Request': Invalid URL '/api/contracts'" error
- ✅ Contract addresses are now fetched client-side only
- ✅ Proper fallback configuration for SSR scenarios

### 2. Better Performance
- Client-side caching with 30-second cache duration
- Automatic refetch on component mount
- Optimistic updates after successful transactions

### 3. Improved Developer Experience
- Consistent hook naming convention (`useXxx`)
- Better error handling and loading states
- Type safety maintained throughout

### 4. Cleaner Architecture
- Removed server-side dependencies
- All contract interactions are now client-side
- Better separation of concerns

## Verification
- ✅ Docker logs show successful API calls to `/api/contracts`
- ✅ No more "Invalid URL" errors in frontend
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ Application compiles and runs successfully

## Next Steps
The frontend now uses a clean, client-side only architecture for contract interactions. All contract addresses are fetched dynamically and cached appropriately, providing a better user experience while maintaining type safety and error handling.
