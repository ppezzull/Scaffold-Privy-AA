## üèóÔ∏è Revolutionary Healthcare Pool Architecture

### Core Innovation: Yield-Generating Healthcare Funds
- **Patient Pool Deposits**: Monthly premiums earn yield in Aave V3 pools while awaiting claims
- **Insurer Pool Contributions**: Insurance companies deposit operational funds earning interest
- **Authorization-Based Withdrawals**: Funds released to hospitals only after claim authorization
- **Real-time Liquidity Management**: Dynamic pool rebalancing based on claim volume
- **Capital Efficiency**: Idle healthcare funds productive until needed

### Dual Patient Registration Paths
**Option A: Existing Insurance Coverage**
- Patient receives mailproof from verified insurer confirming coverage
- Privacy-preserving commitment creation with insurer verification
- Automatic access to existing insurer pool funds

**Option B: New Insurance Selection**
- Patient browses verified insurers on platform
- Selects preferred insurer and coverage plan
- Sets up automated monthly mUSD payments to Aave pool

### Core Components
- **RegistrationContract.sol**: Dual-path patient/organization registration with multi-owner system
- **PoolingContract.sol**: Aave V3 healthcare pool management with yield distribution
- **PatientModule.sol**: Insurance selection flow and monthly payment setup
- **InsuranceContract.sol**: Native mUSD policy coverage with pool integration
- **ClaimProcessingContract.sol**: Pool authorization and fund release triggers
- **vlayer Stack**: Email/Web proof generation and verification infrastructure
- **thirdweb Integration**: Gas sponsorship and smart account management

### Privacy & Yield Features
- **Zero Personal Data**: Patient information stored as cryptographic commitments
- **Yield Generation**: Healthcare funds earn interest while awaiting claims
- **Pool Authorization**: Smart contract triggers for claim payments
- **Multi-Proof Validation**: Combined MailProof + WebProof + ZK proof validation
- **Native mUSD Processing**: Stable value handling without volatility risk
- **Sponsored Transactions**: Gas-free interactions via thirdweb paymaster
